## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the psychology level of online gamers based on their responses to standardized questionnaires. The collected data will be preprocessed, and the machine learning model will be trained using the training dataset to predict the psychology level of online gamers. The potential applications of this project include providing appropriate interventions for online gamers who are at risk of depression, such as counseling or mental health support.
